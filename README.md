# Project-2-Toy-Circles
This is a subscription app that sends out toys monthly based on questions asked to you when you subscribe.
When you choose to sign up, you fill a form with your name, email, set a password and mailing address. There'll also be a portion that'll ask you about your kid(s)(how many you have, their age(s) and their likes/interests). Based on that, a list of toys will be curated and sent to them monthly. You can log in and see your curated toys and the expected arrival date. And there is also an admin page that's tied to my email address where I can see the inventory, the amount in stock, images and more details about the toys. There's also a page with info about subscribers and subscriber demographics.
